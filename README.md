# GScholarAutoSaver


## Overview

GScholarAutoSaver is a utility script designed to automate the process of saving Google Scholar search results to your default library. Normally, downloading a large number of search results from Google Scholar requires manually saving each item to your library, which can be tedious and impractical for extensive searches. This script simplifies the process by automatically saving all search results for you.

## How It Works

The script operates by identifying all unselected (blank) stars on the Google Scholar page, which indicate items not yet saved to your library, and then clicking them to save each item. If no unselected stars are found, the script scrolls down the page to reveal more results. Upon reaching the end of the page, it automatically clicks the "Next" button to proceed to the next page of results.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initiate Your Search on Google Scholar:** Begin by conducting your search on Google Scholar as you normally would.
2. **Run the GScholarAutoSaver Script:** With your search results displayed, run the GScholarAutoSaver script.
3. **Let the Script Work:** The script will automatically process each page of search results. Should a CAPTCHA challenge appear, it will require manual completion.

## Important Notes

- **CAPTCHA Challenges:** Google Scholar may present CAPTCHA challenges to verify that the interaction is not automated. When this happens, the script will pause, and you'll need to manually complete the CAPTCHA to continue.
- **Rate Limits and Bans:** Be aware that automated scripts can lead to temporary bans or rate limits from Google Scholar if detected. Use this script responsibly and sparingly to minimize the risk of encountering these issues.
